# pytorch_nn

This repository holds my reimplementation of select PyTorch Layers and Architectures , using PyTorch Tensors API and [einops](https://github.com/arogozhnikov/einops), for self-educational purposes.

The code will likely not be beautiful, nor performant, even though I will try to learn optimized variants of certain layers.

Nothing useful here for you, I am afraid.

If, for some wild reason, you would like to give your thoughts or discuss certain implementations, do open an issue.
